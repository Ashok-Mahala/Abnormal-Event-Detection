Abnormal_Event_Detection
Abnormal Event Detection in Videos using SpatioTemporal AutoEncoder

Dependencies:
Install ffmpeg for Video frame extraction.

Library based Dependencies:
numpy

sklearn

keras

tensorflow

h5py
(download h5py software also)

scipy

OpenCV

Instructions
Run processor.py with arguments as the path of Video directory and frame rate.

Run train.py to train the model(if you are using for same testing videos no need to train again already trained model model.h5 is there so please use it)

Run test.py to test on testing data.(delete previous frames folder and paste the testing video then run test.py)

Run start_live_feed.py to test the model on live webcam feed.

You can adjust the threshold parameter in test.py to different values to adjust sensitivity
